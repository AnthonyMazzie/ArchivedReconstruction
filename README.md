# ArchivedReconstruction

This program reconstructs/unzips a compressed message archived with a binary-treebased algorithm.

The file extension of the compressed message file will end in .arch, e.g. monalisa.arch.

The user is asked for a single filename at the start of the program.

Using recursive preorder traversal the decoded message is printed to the console.

There are four example .arch files included in this repository.
